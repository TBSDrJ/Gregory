/********************
I am NOT using the standard mathematical definition of a Rational Function
in this library, because of the problem I am trying to solve.  In general,
I am assuming that I have a function of the form g(x) = [a(x)b(L)]/[c(x)d(L)],
where L = ln(x+1), with a,b,c,d all polynomials with integer coefficients.  
So, you can use these functions on standard rational functions by setting 
b = d = 1 (the constant polynomial of degree zero).
